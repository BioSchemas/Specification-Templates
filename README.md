# Bioschemas.org map2model

**map2model** is a Python module that facilitates [Bioschemas Groups](http://bioschemas.org/groups/) in the specification definition process.

> If you want to modify the Flow Chart [Click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9lW_BhBep0TY3NpZ3ZxRnAySkk/view?usp=sharing) and store the result in the *doc > img* folder with the name **map2model_workflow.jpg**.

**map2model** retrieves properties and Bioschemas fields (Marginality, Cardinality and Controlled Vocabularies) from Bioschemas mapping files (in GDrive), then classifies properties into two groups:
1. **Extended properties:** Properties that are part of the extended schema.org Type. 
1. **New properties:** Properties that are new to the schema.org vocabulary or are completely new to schema.org.
      
After classifing the properties, **map2model** generates a Markdown file that can be interpreted by Bioschemas.org's Jekyll implementation thereby updating the Bioschemas.org web pages.

Comments on each specifications should be done through github enabling tracking and execution of corrections.

## Run map2model on your computer

### Requirements

Before starting, please ensure you have the following installed:
1. Git [https://git-scm.com/downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
1. Python 3  [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
1. Pip [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)


### Executing map2model

1. Clone the **map2model** repository: ```git clone https://github.com/BioSchemas/map2model.git```
1. Add the [Bioschemas GDrive Folder](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8yXU9SkT3ftaWJtTGYyTTJjck0) to your Google Account Drive.
      > In your Gooogle Drive Account go to **Shared with me**, right click the **Bioschemas.org** folder and select **Add to my Drive**)
1. Open the Terminal or Console application of your Operating System and go to the folder where you cloned the **map2model** repository.
1. Modify ```configuration.yml```in your forked repository (configuration.yml file tells map2model which **Types/Profiles** mapping spreadsheets parse to a specification. ***If you need further explanation to modify .yml file, please refer to Adding new specifications of this readme.*
1. Install Python dependencies using the command ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```.
1. Run the map2model module by executing the command ```python3 run.py```.
1. After executing the ```run.py``` command a web browser will ask for a Google Account authentication. **Log in using the account you used for step 2.** 
1. Once complete, the new markdown files can be found in the *map2model > docs > spec_files* folder. There should be a folder per each specification listed in ```configuration.yml```.

### Update specifications repository

1. Fork [Bioschemas specification repository](https://github.com/BioSchemas/specifications)
1. Upload all ```specification.html``` files generated by **map2model** to the respective folder in your forked specifications root.
      > If it is the first time you generate an specification **copy all the files** to the root of your forked repository. **Be carefull of not overriding README.md or examples.** The README.md and examples generated by **map2model** work as template files that can be modified by specification's collaboratos. 
1. Check everthing is OK.
1. Make a **Pull Request** of your specifications repository fork.
1. Wait until your **Pull Request** is merged to [Bioschemas Web](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas.github.io)
      > To preserve [Bioschemas Web Page](http://bioschemas.org), changes to [bioschemas.github.io repository](https://github.com/BioSchemas/bioschemas.github.io) will be issued by Bioschemas Web Master.
1. Check your changes at [Specifications Bioschemas Web section](htt://bioschemas.org/bsc_specs)

## Advance user's documentation

###Adding new specifications

If you have created a new specification (or a specification is missing from the *map2model > docs > specification_md_files* folder) you will need to extend the *map2model > spec2model > configuration.yml* file.

If you are unfamilar with yaml, please read [http://yaml.org/](http://yaml.org/).

1. Open the *map2model > spec2model > [configuration.yml](https://github.com/BioSchemas/map2model/blob/master/spec2model/configuration.yml)* file.
1. Erase all the file content and start the ```.yml``` file with
```
specifications:
```
1. Add the following yaml structure per each specification:
```
  - name : 
    g_folder: 
    g_mapping_file: 
    status: revision
    spec_type: Profile
    use_cases_url:
    version: 0.0.1
```
      - Please be careful with spacing, as it is important in YAML!
1. Apart from *use_case_url* all fields must have a value:
      - *name* is the name of the specification
      - *g_folder* is the name of the gDocs folder in which the new specification exists. E.g., a *Tool* specification will be found in the **Tool** folder (i.e., *gDrive > BioSchemas.org > Specifications > Tool*). 
      - *g_mapping_file* : in the *g_folder* you should have a mapping file based on the [original template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OMBiB8SXiRe1b3Cl91IuNlHbJ9_UXHg8B-GY0MYRSaY/edit?usp=sharing). Write the name of the mapping file here, e.g., **Tool Mapping**.
      - *use_cases_url* : in the *g_folder* you may have a use case document. If it exists, paste a link to it here.
1. Re-run ```python3 run.py```. Your new markdown files should be in the *bioschemas-map2model > docs > specification_md_files* folder. 

### Create your own client_secrets.json

> map2model can work with the generic client_secrets file, but here you have the process to create your own json.

##### Create a new Google's APIs Project and add Google Drive API Client:
- Go to [Google's APIs Console](https://console.developers.google.com/iam-admin/projects) and create your own project. Call it whatever you want.
- You will need to wait for a few moments while Google creates the project. Refresh the page and you should see your new project listed.
- Click on the **Google APIs** logo (top left of screen). If you have existing projects, select the new one in the dropdown box next to the Google APIs logo.
- Under **G Suite APIs** you will see **Drive API**. Click on it.
- On the next page, click on **Enable**
- You should see a yellow warning at the top of the page informing you of the need for credentials. Do **not** click the create credentials button at the right of this warning. Instead click the **key icon** in the left menu bar.
- In the new dialog box there is a dropdown called **create credentials**... choose **OAuth client ID**. 
- A form with radio buttons will appear, but it is greyed out and you cannot select anything. Instead click the blue  **Configure consent screen** button on the right.
- In the new form enter whatever **product name** you wish and click **save**.
- You will be returned to the form with radio buttons; select **Web application**.
- In the text box called 'Authorised Javascript origins' type http://localhost:8080 (notice the lack of a trailing slash)
- In the text box called 'Authorised redirect URIs' type http://localhost:8080/ (notice the trailing slash)
- Click **create** then **OK**.
- You will be on a page called 'Credentials' which has a table with the name of your new app. At the far right you will see a download icon (an arrow pointing down, above a line). Clicking on this allows you to download your credentials.
- The downloaded file will have a very long name, e.g., *client_secret_896441073116-l0karljg25m6uvss45t48ufb9d7u3kku.apps.googleusercontent.com*. Change the name to **client_secrets.json** and move it to the top level of your cloned **bioschemas-map2model** repository.
