In the following README you will have the process to create:
1. Use Case Study
1. Mapping
1. Specification

>These explanations will be supported by an example of the **Bioscheas Tools Specification**.

After Defining the properties, the Schema.org type and you will need to follow the steps bellow to get the new Specification Structure.
